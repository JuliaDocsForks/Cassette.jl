# Cassette

## DISCLAIMER

Cassette is still in development. At any given time, the implementation might be ugly,
buggy, incomplete, slow, and/or untested. Cassette relies on new reflection features and
compiler performance improvements that will hopefully land in Julia 1.0; until an initial
version of Cassette is released, I can't guarantee that Cassette's `master` branch won't
rely on some weird custom version of Julia.
