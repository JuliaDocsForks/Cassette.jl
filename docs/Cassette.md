# What is Cassette?

Cassette is a Julia package that provides a just-in-time (JIT) IR pass injection mechanism,
or **overdubbing mechanism**, that can be used to interleave external code transformations
with Julia's normal JIT-compilation cycle. As part of this overdubbing mechanism, Cassette
provides a **contextual execution framework** for the Julia language via the implementation
of **contextual dispatch** and **contextual metadata propagation**. This framework enables
users to define new "contexts" that overlay normal Julia methods that can then be dispatched
on using Julia's existing operator-overloading syntax. Using its overdubbing mechanism,
Cassette can equip context-unaware Julia code with context-specific behaviors, enabling
granular method interception and metadata propagation within "black-box" user code.

Downstream applications for Cassette include automatic differentiation, interval constraint
programming, dynamic code analysis (e.g. profiling, `rr`-style debugging, etc.), JIT
transpilation to GPU backends, automatic parallelization/rescheduling, memoization,
high-level automated memory management and code fuzzing.

Outside of Julia, the LLVM community has long benefitted from modular compiler extensions in
the form of its Pass ecosystem. In a similar vein, we hope that Cassette's overdubbing
mechanism can eventually be used to jump-start an ecosystem of Julia compiler "plugins" -
modular extensions that implement new compiler optimizations and features external to the
compiler itself. In fact, there is already [previous work in this
regime](https://github.com/IntelLabs/ParallelAccelerator.jl) that could drastically benefit
from a formal, standardized approach to compiler extension.

# Background

To understand how Cassette works, one must first have at least a cursory knowledge of
where Cassette fits into Julia's run-compile cycle, as well as Julia's `@generated`
function feature. An explanation of the former is given in the following section, while an
explanation of the latter is given in [Julia's official `@generated` function
documentation](https://docs.julialang.org/en/latest/manual/metaprogramming/#Generated-functions-1).

## Julia's Run-Compile Cycle

A diagram of Julia's run-compile cycle is shown below. While this diagram is quite
incomplete<sup id="f1-anchor">[1](#f1)</sup>, it is sufficient for the purposes of
understanding Cassette.

![Compilation Cycle](compile-cycle.png)

Here, the colored boxes are phases of the run-compile cycle, the arrows denote execution
flow, and the gray boxes are the input/output of each phase. The red boxes are phases that
Cassette interacts with directly; we will describe this interaction in detail later on. In
the meantime, here's an outline of the process described by the diagram, starting at
"Function Call":

1. A function call is the application of a callable Julia object (the function) on other
Julia objects (the arguments). The function call is resolved to its corresponding method
body by dispatching on the call's type signature. For example, `f(1.0, "a", [1 + im])` has
the type signature `Tuple{typeof(f),Float64,String,Vector{Complex{Int}}}`.

2. Dispatch occurs via a lookup performed on Julia's internal method table, using the
call's type signature as a kind of key. This method lookup can yield one of two results.
If the method body for this function call has already been compiled in the past, and
the cached native code from that compilation is still valid (a determination made via
Julia's "world-age" mechanism), then the rest of the compile cycle for this function
call is skipped and the cached native code is executed (i.e., we skip to step 6).
Otherwise, the method lookup yields an untyped Julia AST, represented in Julia's internal
intermediate representation (IR).

3. Assuming that there is no valid cached native code for the function call, Julia's
compiler performs type inference on the method body AST, leveraging the function call's
type signature as a starting point.

4. Various optimization passes - most notably, inlining and `@generated` function
expansion - are interleaved with Julia's type inference process, hence the cycle
formed between "Type Inference" and "Optimizations/Inlining".

5. The type inferred and optimized IR for the method body is passed to the compiler's
code generator, where the IR is converted into LLVM bitcode, which is in turn converted
to executable native code.

6. The native code is executed, potentially returning runtime values that are then fed
to another function call, at which point the cycle repeats.

"parse time" section, which would include Julia AST construction and macro expansion.

## Where Cassette Fits In The Run-Compile Cycle

Later sections will examine Cassette's overdubbing mechanism in detail, but for now, here
is a brief overview of where it fits in the run-compile cycle described above.

As denoted by the red boxes in the run-compile diagram, Cassette interacts with the
"Function Call" and "Optimizations/Inlining" phases. Cassette interacts with the  "Function
Call" phase by wrapping target functions in a callable `Overdub` wrapper type,  whose call
definition is a special `@generated` function. This `@generated` function  exploits the
generator expansion that occurs during the "Optimization/Inlining" phase as an injection
site for Cassette's overdubbing mechanism. In short, `@generated` call definition for
`Overdub` performs a method lookup in order to retrieve the original method's code, then
runs context-specific transformation passes on that code before returning it from the
generator.

In the case of Cassette's contextual execution framework, this overdubbing mechanism
facilitates a JIT-rewrite of the target method's code in order to propagate the context
type and any associated metadata to downstream function calls.

## Changes to Julia's Compiler

made, and several more are planned. Below is a list of relevant GitHub issues and pull

# Cassette's Overdubbing Mechanism and Contextual Dispatch

As stated earlier, Cassette's overdubbing mechanism works by using a wrapper type whose
call definition is a `@generated` function that injects context-specific code
transformations into the compiler's "Optimization/Inlining" phase.

## A Simple Overdubbing Mechanism

```julia
struct Overdub{F,C,w}
    func::F
    context::C
    world::Val{w}
end

function lookup_method_body(::Type{S}, world::UInt) where {S<:Tuple}
    # Return the CodeInfo method body for signature `S` and `world`,
    # if it exists in the method table. Otherwise, return nothing.
end

function overdub_calls(method_body::CodeInfo)
    # Return method_body with every call expression `f(args...)`
    # replaced by `Overdub(f, $template_name)(args...)`
end

@generated function (f::Overdub{F,C,world}})(args...) where {F,C,world}
    signature = Tuple{F,args...}
    method_body = lookup_method_body(signature, world)
    if isa(method_body, CodeInfo)
        method_body = overdub_calls!(pass(C)(signature, method_body))
    else
        method_body = quote
            f.func(args...)
        end
    end
    return method_body
end
```
